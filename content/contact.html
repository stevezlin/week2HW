                    <p> Steve Lin has been working in the education field for the past several
                        years. He graduated from San Jose State University 2010 with a 
                        Bachelors in Communication Studies. After graduating,  he worked at Stanford
                        Univeristy in the Office of Accesible Education. While being there, he 
                        started getting interested  in tech as he helped his friend's company 
                        at Buscomp on the weekends.  During that time, an opportunity presented 
                        itself to teach English in China. Steve went abroad to teach English at
                        Zhicheng Collenge in Fuzhou China.  After being abroad, Steve came back 
                        to teach as a sub but his desire for learning new technologies continued
                        to stir. Now he has decided to take the leap of faith to pursue the desire
                        that has always been within.  Please embark with him as he starts his new
                        journey!
