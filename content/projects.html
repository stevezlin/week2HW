                        created by Guido van Rossum. It has simple easy-to-use syntax, making
                        it the perfect language for someone trying to learn computer programming
                        for the first time.This is a comprehensive guide on how to get started 
                        in Python, why you should learn it  and how you can learn it. However,

                    <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive.
                        It is what gives a page lifeâ€”the interactive elements and animation 
                        that engage a user. If you've ever used a search box on a home page,
                        checked a live baseball score on a news site, or watched a video, 
                        it has likely been produced by JavaScript
