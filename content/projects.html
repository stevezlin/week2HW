                        Python is a powerful high-level, object-oriented programming language
                        created by Guido van Rossum. It has simple easy-to-use syntax, making
                        it the perfect language for someone trying to learn computer programming
                        for the first time.This is a comprehensive guide on how to get started 
                        in Python, why you should learn it  and how you can learn it. However, 
                        if you knowledge of other programming languages and want to quickly 
                        get started with Python, visit Python tutorial page.

                    <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive.
                        It is what gives a page life—the interactive elements and animation 
                        that engage a user. If you've ever used a search box on a home page,
                        checked a live baseball score on a news site, or watched a video, 
                        it has likely been produced by JavaScript
