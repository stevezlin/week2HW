                    <p> Today was the first day of class.  Coming from the South Bay, 
                        it was a bit of an adventure to get to class. I normally
                        drive to most places so taking BART was a new experience since
                        I only used it once previously. Since I live in San Jose, I have
                        to drive 25 minutes to a Warm Springs (Nearest station) and its 
                        another 40 minutes ride.  I actually jumped on the one going to 
                        San Francisco without realizing but I was able to ask a lady on 
                        the train and she was able to tell me where to  get off and transfer.

                        Today in class, we got introduced to HTML.  HTML is the a mark up 
                        language used to make websites.  I was able to make my first website
                        saying<b>"Hello World"</b> and publish it.  We went over a lot in a 
                        short period of time. It was fun but a lot to learn.

                    <p>Welcome! My name is Steve Lin, I invite you join me on my
                        new adventure next year.  I will be enrolling in Kickstart
                        coding.  I have been in education the past few years but I always enjoyed
                        tech.  I am a bit nervous but I know this will help me <b>kickstart</b> or
                        at least help me towards the right direction in pursuing a career in tech.
